## Chapter 4: Pathfinding, Continued
### Dijkstra's: Processing the current node
- In each iteration, select as "current" node the node on the Open list with the smallest cost so far
- For each of the current node's connections, possibly
  - Set the cost so far for the connection's to node
  - Set the path connection by which the to node was reached
  - Add the to node to the Open list
- Whether the to node is updated depends on its status
  - Unvisited: set to node's cost so far = current node's cost so far + connection's cost
  - Open: maybe update, maybe not, TBD
  - Closed: no need to update
- After processing all of current node's connections
  - Remove current node from Open list
  - Add current node to Closed list

### Dijkstra's: Example
#### Iteration 1
``` mermaid
graph LR
  A((A)); B((B)); C((C)); D((D)); E((E)); F((F)); G((G)); curr[Current Node]; goal[Goal Node]
  curr --> A
  A --> B
  A --> C
  A --> D
  C --> D
  B --> E
  B --> F
  F --> G
  goal --> G
  style A fill:khaki
  style B fill:lightgreen
  style C fill:lightgreen
  style D fill:lightgreen
  style E fill:lightgreen
  style F fill:lightgreen
  style G fill:lightgreen
```

#### Iteration 2
``` mermaid
graph LR
  A((A)); B((B)); C((C)); D((D)); E((E)); F((F)); G((G)); curr[Current Node]; goal[Goal Node]
  curr --> B
  A --> B
  A --> C
  A --> D
  C --> D
  B --> E
  B --> F
  F --> G
  goal --> G
  style A fill:tomato
  style B fill:khaki
  style C fill:khaki
  style D fill:khaki
  style E fill:lightgreen
  style F fill:lightgreen
  style G fill:lightgreen
```

#### Iteration 3
``` mermaid
graph LR
  A((A)); B((B)); C((C)); D((D)); E((E)); F((F)); G((G)); curr[Current Node]; goal[Goal Node]
  curr --> C
  A --> B
  A --> C
  A --> D
  C --> D
  B --> E
  B --> F
  F --> G
  goal --> G
  style A fill:tomato
  style B fill:tomato
  style C fill:khaki
  style D fill:khaki
  style E fill:khaki
  style F fill:khaki
  style G fill:lightgreen
```

### Dijkstra's: Terminating
- In general: stop when the Open list is empty
- Pathfinding: stop when either the goal node...
  - has the smallest cost so far in the Open list
  - is visited first during an iteration as a to node connected to the current node

### Dijkstra's: Retrieving the shortest path
- Traverse shortest path in reverse
  - Start from goal node
  - Follow path connection back to previous node in path
  - etc., missed the remainder
