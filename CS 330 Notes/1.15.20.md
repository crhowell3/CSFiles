# CS330 Notes 15 January 2020
## Chapter 2: Game AI, Continued
### Multi-core processing and hyper-threading
- Modern processing threads
  - Multiple processor cores
  - Increased hardware support for parallel processing
- Parallelization of software
  - Done automatically by compiler or operating system
  - Done manually by the developer
- Terminology
  - **Core**:
    - complete independent processor within a CPU
  - **Thread**:
    - single sequence of instruction execution
  - **Multi-core**:
    - multiple cores within a single CPU
  - **Super-scalar**:
    - processor design that executes different instructions from same thread concurrently in the same core
- Game AI approaches: one thread per character, or AI in a different thread from other game functions.

### Direct and indirect function calls
- Game AI implementations may contain function calls
- Conventional function calls
  - Address contained in machine code
  - Super-scalar optimized for this
- Virtual function calls
  - Address stored in memory
  - C++ implemented this way
  - Problem for super-scalar
- Consequences:
  - Conventional is faster
  - Virtual is flexible and supports polymorphism

### Memory considerations
- Game AI memory budget
  - a decade ago: 1-8 MB
  - today: much, much larger
- Allocation and garbage collection
  - Memory allocation by OS to program as needed
  - LLL require programmers to de-allocate memory manually
    - A memory leak can occur if memory is not de-allocated
  - HLL garbage-collect automatically
    - Garbage collection can slow execution, however
- Cache
  - High-speed memory that processor can access directly
  - Data fetched when data needed is not in cache
  - Data written when space is needed to bring other data into the cache
  - Data fetched and written in pages
  - Cache misses can slow execution
    - Workaround: keep data likely to be processed at same time together in memory which is contrary to OOP principles

### General hardware considerations
- Personal computers
  - PC hardware varies widely from machine to machine
  - Amount of computational power available to AI unpredictable
  - AI for main characters not scaled to machine
  - Probably should scale AI for secondary characters to the specifications of the machine
- Consoles
  - Specific hardware config known to developer
  - AI processor and memory budgets known and fixed
  - Console designs optimized for graphics and may restrict AI
- Mobile
  - Increasingly more common
  - iOS and Android
  - Apple encourages Swift, and Android encourages Java for high level programming
    - Both use C/C++ for low-level programming
  - Game engines support mobile platforms
  - Increasing power of mobile platforms means same AI algorithms can be used for PCs, consoles, and mobile devices
- Virtual Reality
  - Immerses player in a 3D virtual world
  - May detect player movement and hand motion
  - Must have high frame rate to avoid motion sickness
  - For 3D, must use different images for each eye
  - Specialized devices like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive
- Augmented Reality
  - In augmented reality, a semi-transparent display allowed game elements to be overlaid on the real world
  - Standard display adds computer generated elements to images of the real world
- According to Millington, VR and AR do not require any unusual AI algorithms

### The AI Engine
- Game engine
  - Consistent technical platform for game development
  - Low-level code shared among games
- AI engine
  - Consistent techincal platform for AI development
  - Low-level code shared among characters and game

### Game AI Model
- See figure 2.1 in notes online

### Creating character AI
- Character AI assembled from
  - Repertoire of AI algorithms and character behaviors
  - Scripts or decision logic that selects and invokes them
  - Mark ups embedded in world database to assist AI
- Types of character AI editors
  - Rule-based
    - textual, resembles program code
  - Symbolic
    - graphical symbols for consideration and state machines

### Game AI engine in context
- **Note**: look up PlantUI online for UML
- See figure 2.2 (modified) in notes online

### Homework
- See Canvas for the homework assignment document
- **Due 22 January 2020**
- Might analyze mob AI, i.e. hostile, passive, neutral, etc.

## Chapter 3: Movement
### The basics of movement algorithms
- Movement
  - Lowest level of game AI in the framework
  - Some games are all movement, others have no movement
  - Movement usually physics-based or seemingly physics-based
- When needed in game, can be important
  - Good movement can compensate for simple AI
  - Bad movement can negate good AI
- Overlaps with animation
  - **Animation**:
    - motion that is precomputed and then played back
  - **Movement**:
    - motion that is calculated as it is executed

### Dimensionality
- Movement dimensions
  - Most game movement is calculated in 2D
  - Character's movement usually constrained to 2D by gravity
  - Infrequent 3D movement handled separately
- Character dimensions
  - Characters usually treated as points
  - 0D point used for acceleration, center of mass, etc.
  - 3D volume used for collision detection
- 2.5D
  - Full 3D geometry is complex
  - Many games use 2.5D for simplification
  - 2.5D assumes the character is upright -> one orientation variable
  - 2.5D not suitable for some games, e.g. flight simulators
