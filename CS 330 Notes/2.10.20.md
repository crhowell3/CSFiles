### Path Following
- Path following method 1: "Chase the rabbit"
  - Map current character position to closest path point
  - Calculate position at fixed distance farther along path
  - Pass calculated position as target to Seek behavior

### Path parameter
- Definition
  - Measure of distance along path
  - Increases monotonically from beginning of path to the end of the path
- Details
  - Can be implemented as actual distance along path
  - Can be implemented as normalized portion of path length
  - Assumes/requires path to have designated "begin" and "end" points
  - Path-following algorithm depends on path parameter

### Path following
``` java
class FollowPath extends Seek{
  float path;
  float pathOffset;
  float currentParam;

  public static SteeringOutput getSteering(){
    currentParam = path.getParam(character.position, currentParam);

    targetParam = currentParam + pathOffset;

    target.position = path.getPosition(targetParam);

    return Seek.getSteering();
  }
}
//Note: this is just pseudo. This is not functioning Java code
class Path{
  float getParam(Vector position, float lastParam){}
  Vector getPosition(float param){}
}
```
