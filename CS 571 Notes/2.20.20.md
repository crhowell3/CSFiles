## Physics in Corona
### Supporting Physics Simulation in Lua
- Corona uses the *Box2D* engine to provide 2D physics
- The Physics API Allows you to add physics to your apps easily
- Corona will extend display objects to support physics effects/properties
- Physics API automatically translates between onscreen units and the metric units of the physical simulation
  - Angular values are in degrees

### Physics
- Physics setup
``` lua
local physics = require("physics");
```
- Simulation options
``` lua
physics.setGravity(x, y)
physics.setScale()
```
- This changes the accuracy of the physical model. No physical change when scaling
- The physical world is based on interactions of physical bodies
- You can add or remove physical bodies like these:
``` lua
physics.addBody( object, method, options )
physics.removeBody()
```
- Method:
  - Dynamic - default; any moving object affected by gravity, forces or velocity
  - Static - not affected by gravity, forces or velocity settings and collides only with dynamic bodies
  - Kinematic - not affected by gravity for forces
    - *velocity can be set*
    - Collide only with dynamic bodies: collision occurs only against dynamic bodies
    - Can be moved by the user
- Options:
  - friction: default is 0.3
  - bounce: 0 and up
    - default is 0.2
    - 1 will rebound forever
  - density: 1 is supposed to simulate water
  - outline: specify the body boundaries provided by
``` lua
graphics.newOutline()
```
  - radius
  - shape
