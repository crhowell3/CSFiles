## Chapter 4
### Clock Speed
- Clock speed is dependent upon the laws of physics themselves
  - Some processes, like memory access, will require a set period of time that cannot be improved upon
- "Overclocking" is the process of speeding up the clock speed to a frequency that is often greater than what the hardware was designed for to produce improvements in response time
- Clocks can get pretty hot because all that energy that goes into it produces high amounts of heat
  - This is why PCs require some form of heat sink, i.e. liquid cooling, fans, actual heat sinks, etc.
- Signal propagation is defined by the speed of light
  - At 1GHz, light travels 11.8 inches
  - All computer signals travel at the speed of light, but the frequency of the signals is largely affected by the speed of light
    - A signal has to travel from one end of a silicon chip to another, and then back in some cases, so the higher the frequency means the more signals that can be sent in the same period of time across that chip
  - The fastest clock speed recorded is 8.723GHz from the AMD Piledriver-based FX-8370 chip. This record was set in 2014.
    - This chip has to be cooled by liquid nitrogen to achieve this clock speed
- Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS)
  - How long this takes depends on the instructions
    - `SHL` is 1 cycle per instruction
    - `MUL` is 5 cycles per instruction
- CPU execution time depends on the instruction, and the instructions depend on the clock speed
- Mega-Floating Point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS)
  - This metric is much better than the MIPS metric
  - Some computers came with dedicated floating-point processors, but eventually the CPU and the floating-point processor were combined onto a single chip
  - MFLOPS cannot be as easily faked as MIPS
  - Some processors work better with sparse matrices v. full matrices, and vice versa
    - This is also dependent upon the compiler

### Amdahl's Law
- Describes the performance increase given by adding CPUs or adding cores to a CPU to a currently existing system
- Appears to place an upper limit on the max performance increase that can be achieved by optimizing a computer's subsystem
- Highlights the effects of *bottlenecks* in a system
      SpeedUp(P, N) = 1 / {(1 - P) + (P / N)}
                    = P / (P * f) + (1 - f)
- "Only two things are infinite: the universe and WinRAR's trial period, and I'm not sure about the former" - Albert Einstein
