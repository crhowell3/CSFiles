# CS 524 Notes | 17 February 2020
## Test 1 Results Review
### Question 1
11)
``` java
int integer = 5;
float floating = 4.3224f;
sum = integer + floating;
//Java converts the int to a float for the duration of the operation
//Therefore, sum is an implicit float
```
13) Aliasing is NOT a factor in a language's reliability

### Question 2
3) Java will not allow an integer to be assigned a floating point value; however, C/C++ would just truncate the value

### Question 4
3) Gotta be a little bit more specific when comparing concrete syntax v. abstract syntax. My answer that I provided wasn't necessarily wrong, but it did not encapsulate the entirety of the differences

### Question 5
1) The intermediate code portion of the flow chart is really moreso the semantic analysis portion. intermediate code is generated here, but semantic analysis is the larger, overarching process that occurs here

The following flowchart needs to be optimized, but this is a start with using the Mermaid flowchart syntax
``` mermaid

A([Source Program]) -->B[Lexical Analyzer]
    B --> C[Symbol Table]
    B --> D[Syntax Analysis]
    C --> E --> H[Optimization]
    D --> E[Semantic Analysis]
    E --> F[Code Generation]
    F --> G[Computer]
    C --> F
```

## Chapter 6 Notes
### Heterogeneous Arrays
- Heterogeneous arrays are arrays that don't necessarily have the same type of elements

### Array Indexing
- Index range
  - [0 ... (n-1)] - common in the C family, Java; lower subscript implicit in declarations
  - [1 ... n] - some languages
- Index range checking
  - Java, ML, C# specify range checking
  - C, C++, Perl, and Fortran do not specify range checking during execution
- Index/Subscript Types
  - Fortran, C, C++, Java: integer only

### List Comprehensions
- A list comprehension is a way of building a new list based on existing lists
- Example of a Python list comprehension:
``` python
squares = [x*x for x in range(12) if x % 3 == 0]
```

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays
- 1D arrays are equivalent to lists
- 2D arrays are equivalent to matrices

### Rectangular and Jagged Arrays
- The author of the text book argues that langauges that use separate brackets for array dimensioning allow jagged arrays
- By extrapolation, C, C++, and Java support jagged arrays but not rectangular arrays

### Array Slicing
- A slice is a substructure of an array
- Python list/array slices:
``` python
vector = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
vector(3:6)
```

### Implementing Arrays
- The overhead associated with arrays is much greater than that for non-structured variables
- Array references must be mapped to addresses
- Multi-dimensional arrays must be mapped to a linear memory
- Higher dimensions follow a similar pattern

### Implementing 1D Arrays
- Access function maps subscript expressions to an address in the array
- Access function for single-dimension arrays:
  - If the array subscript starts at 0:
  - `addr(list[k]) = addr(list[0] + k * element_size)`
