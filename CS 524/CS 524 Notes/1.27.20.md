## CS524 Notes | 27 January 2020
### Using a DFSA to *recognize* or *reject* a string
- Process the string, one character at a time

### The Lexer & Parser Work Together
- The lexer is called from the parser
- Parser:
  - Get next token
  - Process next token
- Lexer enters start state each time the parser calls for a new token & reads the next input character
- Lexer enters the final state once a valid character has been analyzed

### Lexical Analysis
- Utility program for a lexical analyzer:
  - `getChar`: gets the next character of inputs and puts it in `nextChar` then determines its class
  - `addChar`: puts the character from `nextChar` into the variable where the lexeme is being build, `lexeme`
  - `lookup`: DNF
- The lexical analyzer in the text recognizes lexemes from an expression grammar
- Each token is assigned a numeric value in the lexical analyzer, i.e.:
      #define Int_Lit 10

### Partial State Diagram
- See p. 167 in the textbook

### Lexical Analyzer - Summary
- Purpose:
  - Identify individual lexemes from program text
  - Add identifiers to symbol table
- The lexical analysis portion of a compiler may be generated automatically by a program
- Lexical analysis is frequently based on regular expressions, which can be represented as a DFSA, and then easily converted to code
