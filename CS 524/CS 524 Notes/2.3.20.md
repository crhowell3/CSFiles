# CS 524 Notes | 3 February 2020
## Chapter 5: Variables
### Scope and Lifetime
- NOTE: I had a nosebleed during class, so I do not have a good chunk of the notes.
- Scope: the region of code where that variable is visible
- Lifetime: the period of time that a variable is bound to storage
- These concepts are closely related, but not the same thing

### Referencing Environments
- The *referencing environment* of a statement is the collection of all names that are visible in the statement
- In a static-scoped language, it is the local variables plus all of the visible variables in all of the enclosing scopes
- A subprogram is *active* if its execution has begun but has not yet terminated

### Named Constants
- A *named constant* is a variable that is bound to a value only one time - when it is assigned to storage
  - It cannot be changed
- Advantages: readability and program maintenance
- Used to parameterize programs
- The binding of C++ values to named constants can either be static or dynamic.
