## Python Basics
## Additional String Operations
- `split`: divides a string into a list of substrings
- `split` defaults to blank as the delimiter, but you can specify a different character

### Strings
- After you have split a string into a list of substrings, you may want to convert some of the substrings to specific data types
  - specific casts: int(), float(), long(), and str()
  - If you don't know, you can use the generic val()

### List Functions
``` python
>>> stRec = ['A000', 'jack', grades]
>>> stRec.remove(grades)
>>> stRec
['A000', 'jack']
>>> stRec.append([100, 97, 80])
```
