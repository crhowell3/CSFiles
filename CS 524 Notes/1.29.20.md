## Chapter 5: Variables
### Names
- Length, permissible characters
  - If too short, they cannot be meaningful
    - Early FORTRAN limited the number of characters to 6, only letters and digits
- Special characters
  - Newer languages sometimes use special characters to convey information
  - In PHP, all variables begin with a $ symbol
  - In Perl, all variables begin with special characters to determine the type of the variable
- Case sensitivity
  - Names in C-based languages are case sensitive
  - Names in many other languages are not
  - In case sensitive languages, names that look similar aren't the same; for example, `getdata`, `getData`, and `GetData` are all different identifiers
- Special words
  - A *reserved word* is a special word that can't be redefined by the user, like `for`, `while`, etc.
  - A *keyword* is a word that has a default meaning, but can be redefined by the programmer
    - In FORTRAN, for instance, the keyword `if` can be assigned to a value, i.e. `if = 1`
  - COBOL has the most reserved words of any language
    - Too many reserved words can complicate writability; for instance, in COBOL, some reserved words include `COUNT`, `DAY`, etc., all of which a programmer may want to use as a variable name but can't

### Variables
- Attributes of a Variable
  - *Name* - already discussed
  - *Address* - the memory address with which it is associated
    - Compilers assign logical addresses
  - *Aliases* - if two names can be used to access the same variable, they are called aliases
    - Aliases are created via pointers, reference variables, C and C++ unions
    - Aliases are harmful to readability
  - *Type* - determines the set of values and the set of operations defined for variables of that type
  - *Value* - the contents of the location with which the variable is associated
    - The l-value of a variable is its address
      - i.e, x = ...
    - The r-value of a variable is its value
      - i.e., ... = x
  - Some languages only recognize the l-value meaning
    - `x := !y + 1 //!y => value of y`

### The Concept of Binding
- A *binding* is an association between an entity and an attribute, such as between a variable and its type or value, or between an operation and a symbol
- *Binding type* is the time at which a binding takes place
- Bindings aren't restricted to variables
- Possible Binding Times
  - Language design time - bind operators symbols to operations
  - Compiler design time - bind a type to its representation
  - Compile time - bind a variable to a value
- Static and Dynamic Binding
  - *Static* if it first occurs before run time and remains unchanged
  - *Dynamic* if it first occurs during execution or can change during execution
  - In C, C++, Java and most other compiled languages the binding of type to variable is static, but for Python and other interpreted language it is dynamic
- Declarations / Static Type Binding
  - An *explicit declaration* is a statement used to declare the type of a variable
  - An *implicit declaration* specifies variable type through default naming conventions
- Dynamic Type Binding
  - No declaration
  - Specify variable type by assigning a value in an assignment statement
    - `list = [2, 4.33, 6, 8]`
    - `list = 17.3`
    - Advantage: flexibility
    - Disadvantages:
      - High cost
      - Type error detection by an interpreter is difficult and by a compiler is very difficult
- Storage Bindings and Lifetime
  - There are four categories of scalar variables with respect to storage bindings and lifetime
    - Static
    - Stack-dynamic
    - Explicit heap-dynamic
    - Implicit heap-dynamic
- Categories of Variables by Lifetime
  - Static - bound to memory calls before execution begins and remains bound to the "same" memory cell throughout execution
    - Advantages: efficiency supports history-sensitive subprograms and global variables
    - Disadvantage: lack of flexibility, no dynamically declared variables
