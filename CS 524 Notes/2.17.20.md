## Test 1 Results Review
### Question 1
11)
``` java
int integer = 5;
float floating = 4.3224f;
sum = integer + floating;
//Java converts the int to a float for the duration of the operation
//Therefore, sum is an implicit float
```
13) Aliasing is NOT a factor in a language's reliability

### Question 2
3) Java will not allow an integer to be assigned a floating point value; however, C/C++ would just truncate the value

### Question 4
3) Gotta be a little bit more specific when comparing concrete syntax v. abstract syntax. My answer that I provided wasn't necessarily wrong, but it did not encapsulate the entirety of the differences

### Question 5
1) The intermediate code portion of the flow chart is really moreso the semantic analysis portion. intermediate code is generated here, but semantic analysis is the larger, overarching process that occurs here
