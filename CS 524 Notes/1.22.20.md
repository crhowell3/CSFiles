## CS524 Notes | 22 January 2020
### Introduction to Syntax
- The syntax of a program is a precise definition of all its grammatically correct programs
- Three types
  - Lexical
  - Concrete
  - Abstract

### Concrete and Abstract Syntax
- Concrete has definite symbols
- As is alluded to by the name, abstract contains only the most essential parts, and it also carries some greater annotations

### Introduction/Review
- Compilation consists of
  - Lexical analysis
  - Syntax analysis
  - Intermediate code generation/semantic analysis
  - Code generation
- All of the implementation methods use lexical and syntax analysis
  - Lexical analysis can be a part of syntax analysis, but for various reasons it is usually treated separately

### Reasons to Separate Lexical and Syntax Analysis
- Simplicity - less complex approaches can be used for lexical analysis
- Didn't finish copying from slide, review later

### Lexical Analysis
- Input - a sequence of characters
- Discard - whitespace, comments
- Output - lexemes, a logically cohesive sequence of characters representing a single symbol
- Categories of lexemes are called *tokens*
- Ways to define lexical elements:
  - Natural language descriptions
  - Context free grammars
  - Regular grammars
  - Regular expressions
- Regular grammars are a subset of context-free grammars
  - Regular *grammars* define regular *expressions*
- Regular expressions are patterns that describe a particular class of strings

### Lexical Analyzer Generators
- Input: regular expressions
- Output: a lexical analyzer program
- C/C++: Lex, Flex
- Java: JLex
- The program converts regular expressions into a *deterministic finite state automation*

### State Diagrams and DFSAs
- A state diagram is a directed graph. Nodes are states, edges have labels that show what input characters will cause a change in the state
- There is a unique start state and one or more finish states
- Edges in a state diagram may be labeled with classes of characters
