## Continuation of 2.17.20 Notes
### Record Types
- A record is a possibly heterogeneous aggregate of data elements in which the individual elements are identified by names instead of indexes or keys

### Definition of Records in COBOL
- COBOL uses level numbers to show nested records; others use recursive definition

### Evaluation and Comparison to Arrays
- Records are used when collection of data values is heterogeneous
- Access to array elements is much slower than access to record fields because subscripts are dynamic
- Dynamic subscripts could be used with record field access

### Implementation of Record Type
- Offset address relative to the beginning of the records is associated with each field
- The info for each field is field name, data type, and offset from beginning of the record

### Tuple Types
- A tuple is a data type that is similar to a record, except that the elements are not named
- Used in Python, ML, and F# to allow functions to return multiple values
  - Python
    - Closely related to its lists, but immutable
    - Create with a tuple literal:
```python
myTuple = (3, 5.8, 'apple')
```

### List Types
- The list data type originated with functional languages, beginning with Lisp and Scheme
- Pure functional languages
  - treat computation as the evaluation of a series of functions
  - discourage or forbid mutable variables and assignment statements
  - Other interesting features
- Functional languages are typically inerpreted rather than compiled
- Lists in Lisp and Scheme are delimited by parentheses and use no commas
- Data and code have the same form
  - As data, (A B C) is literally what it is
  - As code, (A B C) is the function A applied to the parameters B and C
- The interpreter needs to know which a list is, so if it is data, we quote it with an apostrophe
  - '(A B C) is data

### List Type Operations
- List Operations in Scheme
  - `CAR` returns the first element of its list parameter
  - `CDR` returns the remainder of its list parameter afer the first element has been removed
  - `CONS` puts its first parameter into its second parameter, a list, to make a new list
- List Operations in ML
  - Lists are written in brackets and the elements are separated by commas
  - List elements must be of the same type
  - The Scheme `CONS` function is a binary operator in ML
- F# Lists
  - List those of ML, except elements are separated by semicolons and `hd` and `tl` are methods of the `List` class
- Python Lists
  - The list data type also serves as Python's array types
  - Unlike Scheme, Common Lisp, ML, and F#, Python's lists are mutable
  - Elements can be a mixture of any type
  - Create a list with an assignment
```python
myList = [3, 5.8, 'apple']
```
  - List elements are referenced with subscripting, with indices beginning at 0
- Haskell's List Comprehensions
  - The original
    `[n * n | n <- [1..10]]`

### Union Types
- A *union* is a type whose variables are allowed to store different type values at different times during execution
- C/C++ union; Pascal/Ada variant record
- Logically, multiple views of same storage
- Infrequently used today
- Can cause issues with type checking at compile time
```cpp
union myUnion { //C/C++ example
  int i;
  float r;
};
myUnion u;

u.i = 10;
u.r = 3.14;
```

### Pointers
- A *pointer* type is a variable that holds the memory address of an object. Pointers literally just point to the memory reference and tell nothing about the actual value of what they are pointing to

### History of Pointers
- Early languages (Fortran, COBOL): static memory only
- Later langauges added pointers for dynamic memory allocation (Pascal, C, C++, Ada)
- Modern langauges like Java do not have explicit pointers but still support dynamic memory allocation. Reference variables serve the same purpose as pointer variables
- Scheme, Prolog, Python, dynamically typed languages in general also have implicit pointers

### Design Issues of Pointers
- What are the scope and lifetime of a pointer variable?
- What is the lifetime of a heap-dynamic variable?
- Are pointers restricted as to the type of value to which they can point?

### Pointer Operations
- Two operations: assignment and dereferencing
- Assignment is used to set a pointer variable's value to some useful address
```c
int A;
int* ptrP;
ptrP = &A;
```
- Dereferencing yields the value stored at the location that the pointer is referencing
