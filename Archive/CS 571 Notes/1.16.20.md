## Part II
### Touch Events
- `event.phase` is a string that identidfies where in the touch sequence the event occurred:
  - "began": a finger touched the screen
  - "moved": a finger moved on the screen
  - "ended": a finger was lifted from the screen
  - "cancelled": the system cancelled touch tracking
- `event.xStart`: the x position of the touch from the "began" phase of the touch sequence

### Tap Events
- Event properties are as follows:
  - `event.numTaps` returns the number of taps on the screen
  - `event.name` is the string "tap"

### Multitouch
- Just add `system.activate("multitouch")`
- Need to manage touch events using `event.id`

### Rotating a Group
- Use `g:rotate()` to rotate objects around an anchor point
  - The argument taken is an angle in degrees

### Timer Functions
- `timer.performWithDelay(delay, listener [, iterations])`
  - 1st parameter is time in milliseconds
  - Last parameter is number of iterations
    - 0 or -1 -> infinite loop
