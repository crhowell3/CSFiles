## Chapter 9: Subprograms
### Fundamentals of Subprograms
- Subprogram: an independent, reusable program unit; performs a single logical task
- Subprogram types:
  - Functions: modeled after mathematical functions that return values directly
  - Subroutines: don't return values directly but instead work by creating side-effects
- C made a distinction between the two types: subroutine-function, procedure-function, etc.
  - Java uses methods
  - C-style functions: value returning or void

### Basic Definitions
- A subprogram declaration describes the interface to the subprogram
- A subprogram definition describes the interface to and the actions of the subprogram abstraction
- A subprogram call is an explicit request that the subprogram be executed
- A subprogram header is the first part of the definition, including the name, the kind of subprogram, and the formal parameters
- The parameter profile of a subprogram is the number, order, and types of its parameters
- The protocol is a subprogram's parameter profile and, if it is a function, its return type

### Procedures and Functions
- Regardless of what we call them, there are two categories of subprograms
  - Procedures or subroutines: collection of statements that define parameterized computations
  - Functions: structurally resemble procedures but are semantically modeled on mathematical functions, i.e., they return one or more values
    - They are expected to produce no side effects

### Local Referencing Environments
- Local variables can be stack-dynamic or static
  - Advantages: Support for recursion and storage for locals is shared among some subprograms
  - Disadvantages: Allocation/de-allocation, initialization time, indirect addressing, no history sensitivity

### Examples of Local Referencing Environments
- In C-based languages, locals are by default stack dynamic, but can be declared static

### Semantic Models of Parameter Passing
- In mode: A value from the caller is used to initialize the corresponding parameter
- Out mode: A value computed by the called subprogram is transmitted to the caller through the parameter
- In-out mode: a value is passed in and a modified value is returned

### Implementation of Parameter Passing
- Pass-by-value
- Pass-by-result
- Pass-by-reference

### Pass-by-value (In Mode)
- The value of the actual parameter is used to initialize the corresponding formal parameter
- Usually implemented by copying the value into the subprogram or sometimes by providing an "access path" to the actual parameter
- Copy is the most common method
- Actual parameter can be a variable, constant, or expression

### Pass-by-Reference (In-Out Mode)
- Pass an access path
- Also called pass-by-sharing
- Advantage: passing process is efficient
- Disadvantages: slower access to formal parameters, potential for unwanted side effects since subprogram can modify value in the caller, unwanted aliases

### Pass-by-Name (In-Out Mode)
- By textual substitution
- Formals are bound to an access method at the time of the call, but actual binding to a value or address takes place at the time of a reference or assignment
- Allows flexibility in late binding
- Implementation requires that the referencing environment of the caller is passed with the parameter, so the actual parameter address can be calculated
