## CS524 Notes | 15 January 2020
### Associativity and Precedence
  - Grammars can define Associativity and Precedence among the operators in an expression
    * Precedence: given two operators, which operator is evaluated first
    * Associativity: evaluation order for adjacent operators/operands
  - Grammar rules that specify the Precedence of the operators:
    * **expr** -> **expr** - **term** | **term**
    * **term** -> **term** / **const** | **const**

### Extended BNF
  - Optional parts are placed in brackets []
  - Alternative parts of RHSs are placed inside parentheses and separated via vertical bars
  - Repetitions (0 or more) are placed inside braces {}

### Grammars as Recognizers
  - While grammars can be used to generate sentences in a language, they can also be used to "recognize" correct sentences and detect syntax errors
    - For example: try to draw a parse tree for the string using the expression grammar
      - B + * C
  - Parsing algorithms in language translators use grammar rules to "recognize" correct programs and locate syntax errors

### Syntax versus Semantics
  - Grammar rules don't specify the operand types to be used with various operators
    - is `true + 13` a legal expression?
    - what is the type of the expression `123.78 + 37`?
    - does `a < b < c` mean the same thing in C/C++ as it does in math?
    - These are the type and semantic issues, not lexical or syntax.

### Semantics
  - Static semantics
    - Syntac rules that can't easily be defined with BNF grammars
  - Dynamic semantics
    - Specify the actual meaning of statements and program units
    - There is no single way to do this as all methods are complex and limited

### Static Semantics
  - Nothing to do with actual meaning
  - Categories of rules that are trouble:
    - Context-free, but cumbersome
    - Non-context-free
  - Called "static" because they can be applied by the compiler

### Attribute Grammars: Definition
  - Defintion:
    - An attribute gramamr is a context-free grammar with the following addition:
      - Each grammar symbol *x* has a set *A(x)* of attribute values
  - Let *X<sub>0</sub>* -> *X<sub>1</sub>* ... *X<sub>n</sub>*
    - DNF copying slide information

### Dynamic Semantics
  - There is no single widely acceptable notation or formalism for describing dynamic semantics
  - Several needs for a methodology and notation for semantics
    - Programmers need to know what statements mean
    - Compiler writers must know exactly what language constructs do
    - Program correctness proofs would be possible
