## Chapter 6: Data Types
### Introduction: Early Data Types
- Data types in early languages were closely modeled on data types that were built in to the hardware
- All types were built into the language; no user-defined types
- Few data structures: arrays, simple character data, and records

### Introduction: Abstract Data Type
- An <span style="color: cornflowerblue;">**A**bstract **D**ata **T**ype</span> (ADT) separates the representation of a data type from its implementation
- ADTs let users define types that model the problem domain and its solution

### Primitive Data Types
- Almost all programming languages provide a set of *primitive data types*.
- Java's signed integer sizes: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
- Some languages even expand the basic hardware set, even to the extent of having integer values of unlimited length
  - Python, Java, etc.
  - Java: `BigInteger` class
  - The arithmetic operators have to be emulated

### PDTs: Floating Points
- Model real numbers, but only as approximations
  - Not all floating point numbers can be represented exactly in binary notation
  - Floating point computations cause a loss of accuracy; e.g. you may get a result similar to the following:
``` java
float x = 0.03;
float y = 0.04;
float z;
z = x - y;
//z = 0.9999999999999998
```
- Precision: accuracy of the fractional part
- Range: smallest negative to largest positive
  - primarily determined by the exponent

### PDTs: Complex
- Some languages support a complex data type

### PDTs: Decimal
- Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) - business apps
  - Essential to COBOL
  - Overcomes the problem with floats - decimal values are exact
- Digits are represented by a 4- or 8-bit binary code
- Some business computers support in hardware
- *Advantage*: accuracy
- *Disadvantages*: limited range, wastes memory (BCD values take more space than binary values)

### Array Operations
- Some languages support operations that treat the array as a single unit
- C/C++/Java/C# don't have array operations
- Python arrays are references to objects

### List Comprehensions
- A list comprehension is a way of building a new list based on existing lists
- Examples of a Python list comprehension:
``` python
 squares = [x*x for x in range(12) if x % 3 == 0]
```
