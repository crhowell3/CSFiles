# CS330 Notes 27 January 2020
## Chapter 3: Movement, Continued
### <span style="color:crimson;">Vector operations</span>
- Vectors: *A* = [*u, v*], *B* = [*w, x*]
- Operations
  - Multiplication by scalar: *c* x *A* = [*cu, cv*]
  - Addition: *A* + *B* = [*u + w, v + x*]
  - Subtraction: *A - B* = *A* + (-1) x *B*
  - Length: |*A*| = &#x221A;(*u*<sup>2</sup> + *v*<sup>2</sup>)
  - Normalization: *A* &#x00F7; |*A*| produces the unit vector
- Special vectors
  - Unit vector: any vector of length 1
  - Zero vector: single vector of length 0
  - Technically, a scalar is just a vector with one element, i.e. *c* &#x21d4; [*u*], *c* is a scalar, |[*u*]| = *c*

### <span style="color:orange;">Vector applications</span>
- In games
  - Position: character's current location
  - Velocity: speed and direction of position change
  - Direction: normalized velocity vector
  - Acceleration: speed and direction of velocity change
- In programming languages
  - 1-dimensional array of same-type elements
  - Some languages offer built-in vector operations

### <span style="color:yellow;">Acceleration, forces, and actuation</span>
- Acceleration and forces
  - Kinematic: velocity &#x2192; position
  - Dynamic: forces &#x2192; acceleration &#x2192; velocity  &#x2192; position
  - Newton's second law of motion: *F = ma*
- Typical applications
  - Human and similar characters: acceleration or velocity
  - Physics-intensive games, e.g. driving and flight
- Actuation
  - Most "well-established" movement algorithms output acceleration
  - Movement algorithms may infer forces with actual step

### <span style="color:limegreen;">Simple movement implementation</span>
- [Check out R code](https://uah.instructure.com/courses/41329/files?preview=3394670)

### <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">Programming assignment 1</span>
- See assignment document [here](https://uah.instructure.com/courses/41329/files) for details
- Due 1 week from today at start of class

### <span style="color:violet;">Kinematic Movement</span>
- Character's facing represented as orientation variable
- Independent facing
  - Facing independent of direction
  - Realism of independent facing depends on character type, e.g., unrealistic for tanks, realistic for spacecraft
- Aligned facing
  - orientation aligned with velocity
  - Instantly; set orientation to match direction each time step
  - Smoothly; angular acceleration direction and possibly magnitude calculated from difference between facing and direction

### <span style="color:blueviolet;">Aligning orientation with movement direction</span>
- Movement direction derived from velocity
