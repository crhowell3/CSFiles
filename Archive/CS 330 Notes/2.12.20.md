# CS 330 Notes | 12 February 2020
## Chapter 3: Movement, continued
### Honestly wasn't paying attention
- So just look at the remainder of the movement slides that he posted
- It's mainly just path following and collision detection using rays
- Also, see if he happened to post the .r file that he was showing in class
- File name is CS 330, Dynamic support v4.r
