## Chapter 3: Movement, Continued
### Coordinate System
- Orthonormal basis
  - 2D: x, z
  - 3D: x, y, z

### Character and object coordinates
- Terminology
  - *Position*: location of character or object in game world, usually as 2D *x*, *z* coordinates
  - *Orientation*: direction object is facing
  - *Rotation*: action of changing orientation
  - *Statics*: position, but not movement
  - *Kinematic* and *dynamic*: types of movement calculation
- Character and object coordinates
  - Position, *x* and *z* linear coordinates w.r.t. *x* and *z* axes
  - Orienation: &#x3c9;<sub>s</sub>

### Angle measures in radians
- In games, the trig circle is rotated 90<sup>o</sup> clockwise, and while the x-axis is the same, the y-axis is inverted and called the z-axis instead

### Scalar orientation
- For instance, scalar orientation would be described as so: a character is located at *x* = 2, *z* = 1, with an orientation of &#x3c9;<sub>s</sub> = 1.5 radians

### Movement math
- Familiarity with vector and matrix operations useful
  - Addition and substraction of vectors
  - Multiplication of vectors and matrices by a scalar
  - Multiplication of matrices
- Positions and orientations
  - 2D: *x* and *z* coords, 2-element vector; orientation &#x3c9;<sub>s</sub>, scalar
  - 2&#189;D: *x*, *y*, *z* coords, 3-element vector

### Movement algorithm structure
- Inputs: Character data
  - Position
  - Velocity
  - Character capabilities
- Inputs: Game world data
  - Other characters' data
  - Level geometry
  - Special locations
  - Game state
- Inputs: Movement target
- From decision making or internal to movement algorithm
- Outputs: Movement request
  - Desired velocity and rotation
  - Forces to apply

### Movement variables
- Variable types:
  - Vector: multiple values
  - Scalar: single value
- Variables: position and orientation
  - Position: location in virtual world; vectors; meters from origin
  - Orientation: direction in virtual world; scalar; radians counterclockwise from +*z*
- Variables: linear and angular velocity
  - Linear acceleration: vector; m/s<sup>2</sup>
  - Angular acceleration: scalar; rad/s<sup>2</sup>

### Kinematic vs dynamic movement algorithms
- Common elements
  - Movement Variables: position, velocity, orientation, rotation
  - Calculation: forces &#x2192; acceleration &#x2192; velocity &#x2192; position
- Outputs from movement algorithms differ

### Updating position and orientation
    class Kinematic:
      position: Vector    # 2D or 3D vector
      orientation: float  # single floating point value
      velocity: Vector    # 2D or 3D vector
      rotation: float     # single floating point value

    class SteeringOutput:
      linear: Vector
      angular: float

    function update(steering: SteeringOutput, time: float)
      # Update the position and orientation
      half_t_sq: float = 0.5 * time * time
      position += velocity * time + steering.linear * half_t_sq
      orientation += rotation * time + steering.angular * half_t_sq

      # Update the velocity and rotation
      velocity += steering.linear * time
      rotation += steering.angular * time

### Newton-Euler-1
    class Kinematic:
      position: Vector    # 2D or 3D vector
      orientation: float  # single floating point value
      velocity: Vector    # 2D or 3D vector
      rotation: float     # single floating point value

    class SteeringOutput:
      linear: Vector
      angular: float

    function update(steering, time)
      # Update the position and orientation
      position += velocity * time
      orientation += rotation * time

      # Update the velocity and rotation
      velocity += steering.linear * time
      rotation += steering.angular * time

### Variable frame rates
- Older games
  - Time measured in frames
  - Implied fixed frame rate
- Modern games
  - Game time measured in seconds
  - Frame rate and time step may vary during execution, depending on processor load and game action
  - Time step = 1 / current frame rate
  - Distance moved = velocity * time step

### Extra credit opportunity
- Re-write plotting program in another language
