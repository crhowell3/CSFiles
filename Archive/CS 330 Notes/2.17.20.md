## Chapter 3: Movement: Combining Steering Behaviors
### Using steering behaviors together
- Using steering behaviors individually
  - Simpler
  - Often sufficient for many characters
  - Higher-level decision making decides which behavior to execute
- Using steering behaviors together
  - Some characters need multiple concurrent steering behaviors
  - Some advanced behaviors are defined using multiple behaviors

### Combining steering behaviors
- Methods to combine steering behaviors
  - Two methods: blending and arbitration
  - Each uses a repertoire of multiple steering behaviors
    - this produces a single steering output
- Blending
  - Executes all relevant steering behaviors
  - Combine individual outputs using a weighted sum
- Arbitration
  - Select specific steering behaviors based on a situation
  - Use selected behavior output

### Weighted blending
- Motivating example:
  - Crowd of protesting characters
  - Characters should stay together as a group
  - Combine Cohesion with Separation
- Weighted blending
  - Each behavior in steering portfolio calculates steering
  - Individual behaviors' steering accelerations combined using a weighted sum

### Weighted blending example: Crowding
- Weighted sum of linear accelerations from two behaviors
  - Cohesion: moves characters toward group center
  - Separation: keeps characters minimum distance apart

### Flocking
- Weighted sum of linear accelerations from three behaviors
  - Cohesion
  - Separation
  - Velocity match

### Prioritized blending notes
- Equilibria
  - Prioritized blending can escape unstable equilibria
  - If higher priority groups return near-zero, Wander moves character away from equilibria point
  - Wander will not effectively escape stable equilibria
- Variable properties
  - Fixed group priorities often acceptable
  - For special applications, it may be useful to change group priorities

### Cooperative Arbitration
- Simply combining behaviors can be problematic
- More sophisticated approaches consider situation, arbitrate among behaviors so they "cooperate"
- Arbitration and cooperation use decision making methods

### Steering pipeline
- An approach to coordinating and arbitrating multiple steering behaviors
- Intermediate between blended steering and "full movement planning"
- Performs well in many problematic situations
- Sequenced decomposition of overall steering tasks into a series of smaller steps and decisions

### Steering pipeline stages (1 of 4)
- Targeter
  - One or multiple Targeters for a single character
  - Generate top-level movement goal
  - Goal consists of "channels"; position, velocity, orientation, rotation
  - Different Targeters may provide different and/or multiple channel values
  - Targeters assumed not to overwrite each other's channel values

### Steering pipeline stages (2 of 4)
- Decomposer
  - One or more Decomposers for a single character
  - Break overall movement goal into closer, more immediate, sub-goals
  - Often used to integrate path-finding with steering
  - Decomposers called in specific order; later Decomposers may further break down sub-goals produced by earlier Decomposers

### Steering pipeline stages (3 of 4)
- Constraint
  - Zero or more constraints for a single character
  - Detect if moving toward next sub-goal violates movement constraints
  - Often represent movement obstacles; both static and dynamic
  - If violation is detected, suggest alternative or additional sub-goal to resolve
  - Multiple constraints called in sequence; may loop for recheck of new sub-goals
  - If no sub-goal resolves all constraints, execute default "deadlock" behavior

### Steering pipeline stages (4 of 4)
- Actuator
  - Only one Actuator for a single character
  - Calculate path to current sub-goal
