## Chapter 3: Movement, Continued
### Path Following
- Path following method 1: "Chase the rabbit"
  - Map current character position to closest path point
  - Calculate position at fixed distance farther along path
  - Pass calculated position as target to Seek behavior

### Path parameter
- Definition
  - Measure of distance along path
  - Increases monotonically from beginning of path to the end of the path
- Details
  - Can be implemented as actual distance along path
  - Can be implemented as normalized portion of path length
  - Assumes/requires path to have designated "begin" and "end" points
  - Path-following algorithm depends on path parameter

### Path following
``` java
class FollowPath extends Seek{
  float path;
  float pathOffset;
  float currentParam;

  public static SteeringOutput getSteering(){
    currentParam = path.getParam(character.position, currentParam);

    targetParam = currentParam + pathOffset;

    target.position = path.getPosition(targetParam);

    return Seek.getSteering();
  }
}
//Note: this is just pseudo. This is not functioning Java code
class Path{
  float getParam(Vector position, float lastParam){}
  Vector getPosition(float param){}
}
```

### Separation
- Definition and uses
  - Maintain reasonable or realistic distance between characters
  - Useful for crowd or pattern of life characters
  - More useful when characters are moving in similar directions
- Details
  - Generates "repulsive" addition to linear acceleration
  - Magnitude of addition proportional to distance; closer &#x2192; more

### Separation implementation roles
- Issue
  - Algorithms loop over all characters, calculating distance to each
  - With few characters, probably acceptable
  - With many characters, can be computationally expensive
- Solution
  - Quadtrees, Binary Space Partition trees, etc.
  - Other sophisticated data structures

### Collision avoidance
- Definition and uses
  - Many characters moving in same area
  - May have crossing of intersecting trajectories
  - For realism, characters should avoid collision

### Collision avoidance methods
- Collision cone method
  - Consider cone in front of character
  - If another character is in the cone, use evade or separation
- Has potential problems; effective only for small numbers
- Collision prediction method
  - Calculate closest approach of two moving characters
  - Adjust movement if closest approach is "too close"
- Details
  - Closest approach not necessarily trajectory crossing point
  - Find time of closest approach, calculate distance at that time
