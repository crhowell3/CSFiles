## Chapter 3: Movement, Continued
### <span style="color:royalblue;">Aligning orientation with movement direction</span>
- Movement direction derived from velocity
- Velocity vector may have length 0 or >0
  - 0 implies the character is not moving

### <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">Kinematic movement algorithms and outputs</span>
- Seek, Flee, Arrive
  - outputs velocity, used to update position
  - outputs orientation, always aligned with velocity
- Wander
  - outputs velocity, used to update position
  - outputs rotation, used to update orientation

### <span style="color:dodgerblue;">Kinematic Seek</span>
    class KinematicSteeringOutput:
      velocity: Vector
      rotation: float

    class KinematicSeek:
      character: Static
      target: Static

      maxSpeed: float

      function getSteering() -> KinematicSteeringOutput:
        result = new KinematicSteeringOutput()

        result.velocity = target.position - character.position

        result.velocity.normalize()
        result.velocity *= maxSpeed

        character.orientation = NewOrientation(character.orientation, result.velocity)

        result.rotation = 0
        return result

### <span style="color:deepskyblue;">Kinematic Flee</spam>
- This is the exact same as the code above **EXCEPT** that line 14 is now `result.velocity = character.position - target.position`

### <span style="color:skyblue;">Kinematic Arrive</span>
- Seek algorithm
  - Potentially too simple, if character meant to stop at target
  - Because character always moves at max speed, likely to overshoot, reverse direction, etc.
- Arrive algorithm
  - Tests if character is within "close enough" radius, and stops
  - If not within radius, sets speed based on distance to the target
- Pseudo in PPT slides

### <span style="color:lightblue;">Kinematic Wander</span>
- Move randomly, but not completely erratically
- Uses for wandering
  - Primary characters who have not yet activated for a more purposeful activity
  - Secondary characters provide realistic background
- Study pseudo in PPT slides
