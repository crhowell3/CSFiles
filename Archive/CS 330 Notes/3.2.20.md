## Chapter 4: Pathfinding
### Pathfinding purpose
- Characters and movement routes
  - Some characters' movement routes can be preplanned
  - Some characters' movement routes can be random
- Pathfinding connects Decision making and Movement
  - Decision making chooses a movement goal
  - Pathfinding finds a path to get to that goal
  - Movement controls the character's motion along the path
- Routes found by Pathfinding should be "sensible and as short or rapid as possible"

### Pathfinding algorithms and representations
- Most commonly used pathfinding algorithm: A*
  - Executes quickly
  - Effective at finding shortest or lowest cost path
  - Fairly simple to implement
  - Does not operate on "levels" or "terrain"
- A simple graph

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A((1))
  B((2))
  C((3))
  D((4))
  E((5))
  F((6))
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> A
  C --> D
  B --> D
  F --> A
  E --> B
  F --> E
```

### Graph definitions and terminology
- Definition
  - A graph is a nonempty finite set of vertices and a finite set of edges that each connect two nodes
- Formal definition
  - Graph G is defined as an ordered pair (V, E) where V is the set of all vertices in the graph and E is the set of all edges in the graph

### Relationship of graph to level or terrain
- Nodes represent
  - Interior: a defined area
  - Exterior: a small region or portion of outdoor space
- Connections represent
  - Possibility of movement between the two areas or locations
  - Cost of moving between two nodes

### Total path cost on a weighted graph
- The total cost of travelling from one point to another is simply the sum of the weights of all edges that are traversed along the way

### Directed weighted graph
- A directed weighted graph is a graph in which the edges have a direction, meaning that they can only be travelled in the direction that is indicated by the edge
- Directed graphs allow movement in only one direction

### Directed weighted graph definition
- Definition
  - Directed weighted graph G is an ordered triple G = (V, E, w) with vertex set V = {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>}, n > 0, and arc set E = {(v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>)|v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub> $\in$ V ^ v<sub>i</sub> $\neq$ v<sub>j</sub>}

### Adjacency matrix for simple graphs
- Assign numbers to nodes
  - *N* = {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ... , v<sub>n</sub>} where n = |*N*|
