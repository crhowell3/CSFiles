# CS 413 Notes | 17 February 2020
## The Golden Age of Architecture: Article Review
### CISC v RISC Architecture
- CISC was created in the 80s - 1981 to be precise
- The CISC architecure ruled along with PCs until the RISC architecure predominated with the advent of the iPhone

### Problems Discussed
- Dennard Scaling problem
- Moore's Law
  - The current trend shows a slowing down, and we are about 15% behind what the projection should be
- Amdahl's Law
- Security problem
  - The biggest problem is that at the construction set architecure level, security was never considered
  - The creators of the architectures just assumed they could solve that hardware vulnerability with about 500-1,000 lines of code
    - They did not know, however, that most operating systems require millions of lines of code

### The Future, According to the Article
- Software developers will no longer be bailed out by innovations in hardware. Hardware is reaching an asymptote that will not have a solution for some time
- Interpreted languages are much less efficient than compiled languages
  - For instance: simply moving a program from Python to C saw a 47x improvement in time efficiency
  - Adding parallel loops saw a 366x improvement
  - Adding memory optimization saw a 6,727x improvement
  - Adding SLMB instructions saw a 62,806x improvement
- Software efficiency is much more crucial now since hardware can no longer be blamed for inefficiencies in code execution
  - Writing cleaner, optimized programs is of utmost importance

### Domain Specific Architecture (DSA)
- Scaling down floating point requirements makes processing much more efficient
- In some cases, especially visual processing, 8-bit floating points is enough

### Domain Specific Language (DSL)
- Used often concurrently with DSAs so that code can be optimized and made more efficient for the situation at hand (AKA the domain)

### Open Arch
- Open source architecture - like Linux - is great for developers because we can actively manipulate it to correct a problem or implement some new functionality
- The article mentions the RISC-V architecure chips when discussing Open Arch
- ARM and Intel are copyrighted and protected, so trying to implement those into something like the RISC-V is theoretically illegal (only if you were to actually create an architecture that uses those copyrighted features and then sold it; personally, it shouldn't be a problem if implemented on a home chip)

### Agile Development
- For something like the Orion mission, Agile is not a great method because it is much too quick
  - Since all the millions of lines of code is human-tested, using something this fast-paced could lead to a slip up that could literally kill people
- Agile will not survive the next few years
  - No software development method has ever lasted over 25 years
  - Agile is just a fad; while it can be useful, it will not last much longer when someone else comes along with something much better
